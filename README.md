# GRB-Analysis
For my Master's project work on Gamma Ray Bursts I have worked on extensive SED analysis and ICS physical modelling in the GRB jet.
I have created this repository to help others with Gamma Ray Burst Analysis.
I have provided all the files which includes lightcurve creation, background subtraction and full spectral analysis.
People can suggest changes to the present codes to increase the efficiency and save time of the people who are doing GRB research.
I have created essential functions on top of threeML so as to make the scripts more concise.
Each suggestion and help is much appreciated!!
