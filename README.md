# GRB-Analysis
I have created this repository to help others and myself with Gamma Ray Burst Data Analysis.
People can suggest changes to the present codes to increase the efficiency and save time of the people who are doing GRB research.
Right now I basically need help with creating code more concise and more generic so that it can help when dealing with large amount of GRB data.
Each suggestion and help is much appreciated!!
